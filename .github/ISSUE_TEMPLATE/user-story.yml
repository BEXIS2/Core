      A user story should comply with the following criteria
- type: markdown
  attributes:
    value: | 
      **Independent** - Requirements should be as independent of each other as possible, so that they can be implemented in the correct order.
      **Negotiable** - Requirements should be open to discussion regarding implementation.
      **Valuable** - Requirements should always generate (self-contained) added value for the community
      **Estimable** - Every requirement must be appreciated. If the team is unable to provide an estimate, it should be discussed again or refined
      **Small** - The size of the requirement should be defined in such a way that it can be implemented in a sprint. 
      **Testable** - A good requirement contains acceptance criteria from the user's point of view and can be tested by the product owner/stakeholder.
