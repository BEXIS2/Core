        <p><b>On ATTO</b><p>
        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.attoproject.org">Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO)</a> is a joint German-Brazilian project launched in 2009. ATTO is with its tall tower, the associated research infrastructure and scientific plots a unique interdisciplinary scientific platform in a region of global significance. Its core objective is to obtain a detailed understanding of the biogeochemical cycles and energy fluxes at the geo-, bio-, atmosphere interface in the Amazon, and to integrate this knowledge into diverse climate and Earth system models to improve our prognostic abilities regarding climatic and ecological processes as well as our understanding of the various effects of global climate change.</p>
        <p>The ATTO Data portal is a data management platform, built for storing, sharing exchanging and publishing data of the ATTO research consortium scientists.</p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Data accessibility</b><p>
