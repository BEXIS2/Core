            The design follows the RESTFull pattern mentioned in http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/older-versions/creating-a-web-api-that-supports-crud-operations
            CSV formatter is implemented in the DataTupleCsvFormatter class in the Models folder.
            The formatter is registered in the WebApiConfig as an automatic formatter, so if the clinet sets the request's Mime type to text/csv, this formatter will be automatically engaged.
            text/xml and text/json return XML and JSON content accordingly.

             ## format
             Based on the existing transformation options, the converted metadata can be obtained via format.
             
             ## simplfiedJson
             if you set the accept of the request to return a json, you can manipulate the json with this parameter. <br/>
             0 = returns the metadata with full internal structure <br/>
             1 = returns a simplified form of the structure with all fields and attributes <br/>
             2 = returns the metadata in a simplified structure and does not add all fields and attributes that are empty.

            ToDo Refactor submission Commented by Javad due to modularity issues.
            Thes functions should call the APIs of the DIM module and get json objects back.
            If Publication or any other entity is not part of the DLM, it is visible only to its own module.
            Other mosules who consume the API results of a module, should only expect .NET types, DLM types, json, xml, CSV, or Html.
