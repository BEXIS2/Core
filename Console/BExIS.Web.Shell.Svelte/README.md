# BEXIS - Shell - UI

The Svelte Project contains all the pages for the BEXIS 2 Shell area.

## Components & Pages

In general, all BEXIS 2 modules should export pages as Svelte components, because all components should be used within the pages. This achieves the best possible compiler results.

Since we continue to use MVC + C# in the backend, we have a layout file as the standard layout in which, for example, the navigation and the footer can be found.

These are the only components that come directly from the shell project and can be loaded as components.

The following components are accessible


## Components

- Menu.Svelte

## Pages

- UITest.Svelte
