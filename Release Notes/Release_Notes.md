> To install the software, please follow the instructions in the [BEXIS213 Installation Manual](https://github.com/BEXIS2/Documents/blob/2.13/Guides/Installation/installation.md).

## System Functionality

> The software consists of two main types of components; 1) core components that include Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Web Interfaces, Security and some other internally used ones. 2) A collection of coherent features and use-cases bundled as modules so that each module is designed around one or a small set of steps of the DLM workflow i.e., Data Submission, Quality Control/ Assurance, Data Publication and so on.

## Data Collection Module
>The purpose of the data collection module is to allow users to submit data alongside with metadata. The module processes the data in accordance with its data/metadata structure rules to find any inconsistencies and communicates with the user to overcome the issues. The module may also notify or trigger other internal services such as the search indexing engine to make the dataset ready for discovery. Based on the settings of the associated research context/ plan, datasets get versioned.
